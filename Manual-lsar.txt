SYNOPSIS
       lsar [OPTION]...	ARCHIVE...

DESCRIPTION
       List the	contents of ARCHIVEs.

OPTIONS
       -l, -long

       -t, -test
	      Test the integrity of the	files in the archive, if possible.

       -p, -password PASSWORD
	      The password to use for decrypting protected archives.

       -e, -encoding ENCODING
	      The encoding to use for filenames	in the archive,	when it	is not
	      known.  If not specified,	the program  attempts  to  auto-detect
	      the encoding used.  Use "help" or	"list" as the argument to give
	      a	listing	of all supported encodings.

       -E, -password-encoding ENCODING
	      The encoding to use for the password for the archive, when it is
	      not  known.  If not specified, then either the encoding given by
	      the -encoding option or the auto-detected	encoding is used.

       -pe, -print-encoding
	      Print the	auto-detected encoding and the confidence factor after
	      the file list.

       -i, -indexes
	      Instead of specifying the	files to list as filenames or wildcard
	      patterns,	specify	them as	indexes.

       -j, -json
	      Print the	listing	in JSON	format.

       -ja, -json-ascii
	      Print the	listing	in JSON	format,	encoded	as pure	ASCII text.

	      Do not attempt to	list the contents  of  archives	 contained  in
	      other archives.  For instance, when listing a .tar.gz file, only
	      list the .tar file and not its contents.

       -h, -help
	      Display help information.
